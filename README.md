# LearnKanji
Application I developed for learning various things in Japanese. I like it more than things like Quizlet. (pSuite is uncreatively a play on apps like G Suite, get it?)

This file was pretty much developed by me on a plane back from Australia at the equivalent of 2:30 AM, so I didn't bother commenting a lot of it. I plan on going back and fixing this whenever I have time, but as the project is all but complete it's unlikely I'll get to it. Sorry for anyone looking through this about the lack of comments!
